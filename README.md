Executive Summary
Objective: The goal of this analysis was to investigate the relationships between key inflation indicators (Consumer Price Index (CPI), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), Producer Price Index (PPI), and GDP Deflator) and to build a predictive model using linear regression to forecast CPI based on these indicators.

Key Findings: There is a significant correlation between CPI and the other inflation indicators. The linear regression model predicted CPI with a reasonable level of accuracy. The mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared values suggest the model has predictive potential.

Research Questions 
a. What is the relationship between CPI and the other inflation indices (PCE, PPI, and GDP Deflator)? This question explores whether CPI is correlated with other key economic indicators and to what extent changes in PCE, PPI, and GDP Deflator might explain fluctuations in CPI.
b. Can PCE, PPI, and GDP Deflator be used to predict CPI using a linear regression model? This question examines whether the variables (PCE, PPI, and GDP Deflator) can explain the variability in CPI, and whether they are statistically significant predictors for CPI in a regression model.

c. How well does a linear regression model predict CPI compared to actual CPI values? This investigates the accuracy and performance of the linear regression model, as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared value, to see how well the model fits the data.

d. What is the magnitude and direction of the relationship between CPI and the predictor variables (PCE, PPI, and GDP Deflator)? This question looks at the coefficients of the regression model to understand the magnitude and direction of each predictor's influence on CPI.

In this Repo we've included the Jupyter Notebook gathering and analysing the data to answer these quesions. We've also included a brief slidedeck summarizing the key findings as well as image files representing the key visualizations included in the notebook. Lastly, we've included a comparative analysis to explore key insights in more detail.
